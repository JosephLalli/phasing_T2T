# Intermediate Data

This directory contains intermediate analysis files and summary statistics from test region phasing runs.

## Directory Structure
- Contains processed variant statistics and phasing metrics from test regions
- Includes 9 files >50MB with summary data from chr15 and chr22 test regions
- Parquet and CSV files with analysis results

## Contents

### Test Region Results
- **chr15_test** - Angelman/Prader-Willi critical region (15q11.2-13)
- **chr22_test** - 22q11 deletion/duplication region
- Summary statistics for both T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 coordinate systems

### File Types
- **Parquet files** - Processed variant-level statistics and metrics
- **CSV files** - Aggregated phasing accuracy results  
- **Summary tables** - Cross-reference validation statistics

## File Generation

These files are automatically generated by test phasing runs:

```bash
# Generate test region results
./create_and_assess_haplotype_panels.sh chr22_test 12 example_regions_CHM13v2.0 CHM13v2.0
./create_and_assess_haplotype_panels.sh chr15_test 12 example_regions_CHM13v2.0 CHM13v2.0

# Process results into summary files
python3 create_summary_phasing_dataframes_polars_regional.py
```

## Analysis Applications

These intermediate files serve as input for:
- Test validation of phasing pipeline accuracy
- Regional analysis of phasing performance
- Comparison between T2T and GRCh38 reference systems
- Development and debugging of analysis notebooks

## Relationship to Full Genome Data

- Test region results provide rapid validation of pipeline functionality
- Full genome equivalents (that are less than 50mb) are found in `intermediate_data_whole_genome`
