# Phased Panels

This directory contains the output phased haplotype panels generated by the T2T phasing pipeline.

## Directory Structure
- `phased_CHM13v2.0_panel_*/` - T2T-CHM13 phased panels
- `phased_GRCh38_panel_*/` - GRCh38 phased panels  

### Panel Types

#### Full Sample Panels (3,202 samples)
- **All samples** including trio children and parents
- **Pedigree-informed phasing** using family relationship data
- **Maximum accuracy** achieved through trio constraints
- Used for method validation and accuracy assessment

#### Unrelated Sample Panels (2,504 samples)  
- **Unrelated individuals only** excluding parents and children
- Suitable for downstream imputation and analysis
