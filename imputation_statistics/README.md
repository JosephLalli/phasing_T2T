# Imputation Statistics

This directory is where imputation accuracy assessments and cross-reference validation results are saved.

## File Generation

Imputation statistics are generated by assessment scripts:

```bash
# Generate cross-reference imputation statistics
# (This is called by create_and_assess_haplotype_panels.sh)
./scripts/assess_imputation.sh [reference_genome] [chromosome] [working_dir] [reference_dataset] [native_panel] [lifted_panel] [limit_to_snps] [ref_dataset_name]

# Compile genome-wide imputation results  
# (This needs to be manually run)
./scripts/calc_genomewide_imputation_statistics_full.sh $GRCh38_suffix $CHM13_suffix $num_threads true
```
