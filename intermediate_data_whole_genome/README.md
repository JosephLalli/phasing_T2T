# Intermediate Data (Full Genome)

This directory contains intermediate analysis files generated from full-genome phasing runs (all chromosomes 1-22, X, PAR1, PAR2).

## Directory Structure
- Contains the summary data files That are able to be loaded to Github from genome-wide phasing analysis
- Includes processed variant statistics, phasing metrics, and validation results
- Files are organized by analysis type and chromosome

## File Generation

These files are generated by running the full genome analysis pipeline:

```bash
# Collect genome-wide imputation statistics  
./calc_genomewide_imputation_statistics_full.sh $GRCh38_suffix $CHM13_suffix $num_threads true

# Generate full genome summary statistics
python3 create_summary_phasing_dataframes_polars_regional.py
```

## Alternative: Download Pre-computed Results

**Pre-computed summary data** is available from Zenodo to avoid the computational cost of full-genome processing:

```bash
# Download all intermediate and summary dataframes from publication
wget -P intermediate_data_whole_genome/ https://zenodo.org/record/7612953/files/intermediate_data.tar.gz
cd intermediate_data_whole_genome && tar -xzf intermediate_data.tar.gz
```

## File Types

### Summary Statistics Files
- **Parquet files** - Processed variant-level and sample-level statistics  
- **variant_frequency_stats** - Per-contig tsvs containing annotations for every variant, along with MAC/AN stats and lists of variants that are private sigletons (only present in a trio)

## Usage in Analysis

These files serve as input for:
- `notebooks/calc_figures_for_paper.ipynb` - Summary statistics calculation
- `notebooks/calc_per_variant_figures_for_paper.ipynb` - Per-variant analysis  
- `notebooks/make_plots.ipynb` - Publication figure generation
