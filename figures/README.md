# Figures

This directory contains publication figures and visualizations generated from the T2T phasing analysis.

## Directory Structure
- `supplementals/` - Supplementary figures and extended analysis plots
- Main figures - Primary publication figures and variants

## Contents

### Generated Publication Figures
- **Main figures** - Primary results for publication manuscript
- **Extended data figures** - Additional detailed analysis plots
- **Supplementary figures** - Supporting visualizations and method validation
- **Figure variants** - Different versions and formats of key plots

### Figure Types
- **Switch error rate comparisons** - T2T vs GRCh38 phasing accuracy
- **Imputation accuracy plots** - Cross-reference validation results  
- **Regional analysis** - Chromosome-specific and population-specific results
- **Method comparisons** - Different phasing approaches and parameters
- **Quality control plots** - Variant filtering and validation metrics

## Figure Generation

Figures are generated by Jupyter notebooks and R scripts:

### Primary Figure Generation
```bash
# Generate main figures using Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook notebooks/make_plots.ipynb

# Generate Figure 6 using R script  
Rscript scripts/Figure_6_script.R
```


Figures are generated in multiple formats:
- **PNG** - High-resolution raster graphics
- **PDF** - Vector graphics for publication
- **SVG** - Scalable vector graphics for editing
- **EPS** - Encapsulated PostScript for journals
